This folder contains materials for assignment 1 "network reduction technique" on the eye-tracking data set.

There are in total three python scripts, "hidden_unit.py","learning_rate.py" and "number_of_input_features.py", and they all implement the network reduction method proposed by the paper. Further more, each of them investigates the effect of different number of hidden units, number of input features or different values of learning rates on the performance of network reduction, as indicated by their file names. They all output their corresponding training and testing log as plots, and each output plot should be similar to what my submitted papper shows.

Please be patient while running "hidden_unit.py" file, as it may takes a while to finish. The other two files should be faster for your testing purpose.
