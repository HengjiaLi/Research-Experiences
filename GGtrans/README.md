# Project Summary

This website called Google Translate API to help with English translation and writing to eliminate grammatical errors and to reconstruct sentences in the proper order.

Nowadays, more and more Chinese college students are being asked to write English papers. When I returned to China during the summer vacation, some of my friends asked me for help in modifying their English essays. In their paper, I found low-level spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. I introduced the writing correction software "Grammarly" to them, but they would prefer open source solutions. This is why I developed this EasyTranslate website as an alternative solution. A demo video is provided to demonstrate how it works.
