|       Date        |                               Decision                                |                               Reason                              |       Impact      |
|       ----        |                               --------                                |                               ------                              |       ------      |
|       5/3         | **Admin:** Determined two weekly meeting times: <br> Monday 1:30PM with client <br> Friday 2:00PM with team | These meetings were determined based on the availability of each team member and the client. Monday meetings with the client are necessary to track weekly progress, while friday meetings with the team are necessary for weekly task delegation and review. | 
|       11/3        | **Admin:** Initial scope and project expectation were set | The client introduced the project to the team, and set expectation for the project. An initial concept of the device was proposed and accepted by the client. He was happy with the ideas mentioned so far. |
|       11/3        | **Hardware:** The device will be primarily designed around a Raspberry Pi 3B+ Microprocessor | Due to a team member already owning a Raspberry Pi 3B+ (microprocessor device), the team decided that selecting potential imaging/audio hardware should be structured around this microprocessor due to its ease of use and capability for testing. |
|       11/3        | **Admin:** Projected deliverables will be divided into five key subsystems, with each member being allocated to a specific [sub-team](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u5613613/360webcamdocumentaion/blob/master/Team%20roles/Team%20roles.md) | These subsystems and teams were created to efficiently meet the [project requirements](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u5613613/360webcamdocumentaion/blob/master/Meeting%20logs/Meeting_Minutes_11032019.pdf) outlined by the client (page 2) |
|       11/3        | **Hardware:** The purchase of a 4-Mic Array to use in determining sound direction | The microphone array was purchased to allow for delivery time. It was also a critical component and unlikely to change throughout the semester. |
|       11/3        | **Hardware:** The team decided to utilise 4 camera for visual input | A multiple camera set up will be used to provide a 360 degrees view surrounding a conference table. A set of 4 webcams were desirable due to the built in microphone and noise isolation. |
|       14/3        | **Admin:** Addition of GNU open source license for the project | This is to mark the project as an open source project and allow it to be within the public rather than commercial domain. Our client aim is to provide an easy to follow project with instruction on how to create a functional 360 degrees camera|
|       18/3        | **Admin:** The Concept of Operations was approved and signed off by the client | The Concepts of Operations was presented to the client along with prototype design, he was happy with the product design but requested that the video output provide a continuous 360 degrees view similar to OwlLab. |
|       22/3        | **Admin:** The project temporarily halt development for a multiple cameras system | This was due to concerns raised by the client with the viewing angle. It was requested that the baseline goal be altered to include image stitching for a conitnuous 360 degrees view |
|       22/3        | **Hardware:** The team will not utilise 4 cameras for visual input, but will instead use a 180 degree view camera with a fish-eye lens | Based on the [initial concept design](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u5613613/360webcamdocumentaion/blob/master/Deliverable/concept%20design/side_view2.png), the team chose to utilise 4 cameras for the visual input. Through this configuration, a 360 degree view was aimed to be achieved through image stitching to combine the different views of the camera. Testing two web cameras have shown that this solution is limited by the maximum bandwidth that the Raspberry Pi can support - there is a 2 second delay, therefore an alternative camera option must be used. |
|       25/3        | **Admin:** The client approved the use of a 180 degrees FOV camera | After presenting the client with breakdown of costs for a multiple camera system utilising 90 degrees cameras, 120 degrees cameras and a 180 degrees camera, the pros and cons of each system was weighted. In the end, the 180 degrees camera were chosen due to a lower cost while minimising the need for image stitching. |
|       29/3        | **Admin:** Developed a list of action item based on audit feedback | Anonymous reviews from the audit provided some good points of possible improvement for the group. A list of action items were produced to be follow up by the team where possible and response were given where not applicable|
|       1/4         | **Hardware:** The team will utilise a 220 degree FOV camera to allow a wider viewpoint | The client was concerned with how low the 180 degrees camera will need to sit on the table to obtain the entire upper body during a web call. Current commercial 360 degrees web conferencing device utilised camera with FOV larger than 180 degrees, this will remove some size limitation for the prototype|
|       2/4         | **Hardware:** The team purchased a 220 degree FOV camera along with a USB conference microphone from Taobao | The cheapest option for a 220 degrees FOV and conference microphone was found on Taobao, however there will be a slight delay due to deliveries. Therefore, video testing are expected to by the second week of the mid-semester break. |
|       2/4         | **Admin:** Creation of a critical decision making log | Created based on action items from Audit 1, to help team members and external parties keep track of all decision made. |
|       5/4         | **Admin:** The team has decided to create a more coherent documentation process for software and hardware | This decision has a twofold purpose, to create: <br> 1) a document outlining a clear method to follow to reproduce the product <br> 2) a more detailed documentation regarding all the testing and why previous iterations have not worked |
|       12/4        | **Software** Consideration of the Video4Linux Python module as a addition to OpenCV | As the OpenCV does not process MJPEG stream, utilisation of Video4Linux was tested. |
|       26/4        | **Software** Utilisation of deep neural networking face detection | The team made use of rotational invariant face detection in conjunction with a fisheye camera to improve detection rate |
|       3/5         | **Hardware** A modular 3D print design was made for the frame | For the ease of assembly and disassembly, and increase complexity in the future |
|       9/5         | **Software:** Choice to provide a solution using the Linux environment instead of Windows | Has a higher potential of retaining functionalities developed such as face detection |
